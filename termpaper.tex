\section{Overview}
\label{overview}

As more and more companies are leveraging use of big data within
enterprise software applications, social media sites have been high in the 
ranks of contributing groups of data mining and analytics techniques. Some of the
greatest advantages that the big data movement has provided have been through
unanticipated coorelations between data sets that seemed to have no relation
to one another. The social media space has provided troves of publicly accessible 
data that can generate links between seeminly uncommon metrics such as citation prediction
of articles and a user's Twitter feed. \cite{PMC:articles/PMC3278109}

The WSDM conference held in Shanghai China \cite{DBLP:conf/wsdm/2015}
covered many facets of social media and uncovered some uncommon 
relationships between collections of data. While the sheer volume
of data that is publicly available on these networks is cause for analysis, many enterprise
companies are still having difficulty generating new insights from these data sets that
will have a direct, positive impact on their organization.  

Provide the roadmap for the remaining sections of the
paper. For example, you can state that Section \ref{common
  themes} presents common themes in the papers being
surveyed and section \ref{discordant themes} presents
themes where the papers disagree.
